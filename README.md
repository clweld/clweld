- Christine Weld, @clweld.
- I'm a student at NCSU in the undergraduate Computer Programming Certificate, after which I plan to start the Master of Computer Science degree.
- In addition to recent coursework in Java and discrete math, I've also been self-studying JavaScript and HTML/CSS through Codecademy and Launch School.
- Since graduating with my BS in Biology from UF in 2012, I've been working as a Registered Veterinary Technician at several veterinary hospitals.
- I'm working hard to study and train for a complete career shift into software development, and am looking for a position to build skills with first-hand experience.
